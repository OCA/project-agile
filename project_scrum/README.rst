=============
Project Scrum
=============

Organize your tasks with the Scrum and Sprint methodology.

*Create Sprints to manage your task deadlines*
*Manage multiple sprint durations with the possibility of creating different Scrum Teams*

Usage
=====
This module implements all concepts defined by the scrum project management
methodology for IT companies:

- Project with sprints, product owner, scrum master 
- Sprints with reviews, daily meetings, feedbacks 
- Product backlog
- Sprint backlog

The scrum projects and tasks inherit from the real projects and tasks,
so you can continue working on normal tasks that will also include tasks from
scrum projects.
